#this is the punch line of every working neural network
#I dont know how - I dont know what you do
#it has to look like this
#alright so what happens here
#we are trying to build a uniform input logit diffraction
#we are using addition operation to be forgiving on the output space - says we circumscribing the sphere -> multiple spheres which have constructive interference | or f(x) static activations (we can say that hash(logit_vec) mod MODULO) to avoid saturated training rate
#alright - to avoid training destructive interference - we must use hash(unique_representation(x)) - x is the unique representation of the base input logit 
#this is a very very important note 
#alrights - our model can scale - such that there is no such a thing as saturated loss_rate
#yet the logit density does not scale - this is the most important in intelligent system not intelligence system
#logit density can be briefly described as training_data_sz/ neural_network_size for the same discretized loss_rate 
#we'll spend 10 years of doctoral to study logit density
#these are tough materials - the study of the shapes
#alrights - so what do we learn? we learn that intelligence system has low logit density - but good at retaining informations
#                                we learn that intelligent system has high logit density and good at making bullshits - you tell them Aurora 6pm Seattle netflix and chill
#we have 3 weeks to build this guys
#we'll be rich guys - stay tuned
#we'll probably be the firsts to build a distributed network for 1M personal devices (with this rate - people will include top-of-the-line GPUs in iphones soon enough) - which compete for logit density solutions
#we'll build a bid/ask system that is powered by the people, run by the people - just to move logits around

    #this is where the recursion happens - this is precisely the quicksort (mergesort) algorithm
    #for sorting algorithms - we assume that f(x) sorts the array
    #for neural network algorithms - we assume that f(x) groups the context semantically and diffract the context by the replication factor of K (okay - when we diffract the context - we are wasting leaf logits to move things around - this is the argument between locality and logit_density)
    #Ok, this is the important part - for locality purposes - K must be uniformly diffracted all over the output range (like photon and double-slit experiment) - we want this to maximize cuda parallel processing  
    #so a zip of lhs and rhs is essentially a reinvented static merge_sort zip (without comparisons) before we transform it again by mix(lhs, rhs, args...)

    #it is the bad leaf logit density diffraction - in another words, it has the equivalent terrible job of our circle implementation (left | right) 
    #the true discrete operation is hard to implement - I dont know if there is a reasonable implementation than just random seeds
