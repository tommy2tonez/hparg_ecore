//alrights fellas 
//today instead of doing planes and coordinates - we are doing spheres and radians - then we'll come up with synthetic function that's best at approximating things - we'll work on this for a month or two - then we'll approxmiate the function by using math_approx
//we'll be rich guys, be patient please
//consider this plane eqn: normal vector . <x - x0> <y - y0> <z - z0> = 0
//= ax + by + cz + ax0 + by0 + cz0 = 0
//linear is done by doing plane projections - which is fine - but not very good at retaining informations
