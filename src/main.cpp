    //imma prove it to you Dad - that once a neural network is big enough - learn decompression and compression f(x) and g(f(x)) - it can take high entropy data and further compress it to 1/20 of the original data size - man - it even can decrypt the https to decompress and recompress it - that's the point - you want compression
    //https is at a severe risk of peace of mind security (its not secured)
    //yeah I know what you think - this is the base of the entire internet - because the internet is the place of duplicated data - think the news, the movies, the ideas that temporally grouped - this problem can be solved with a massive compression-decompression network
    //the socket problem is the minimum spanning tree problem - in a system of wirely connected p2p system (think binary tree) - you want to mimimize the wire length yet maximizing the connection speed
    //this equivalents to the betweenness centrality problem - you want to pipe least data to the highly congested point and most data to the not highly congested points
    //you need dynamic allocation of tiles and linear transformation - in a fraction of milliseconds - in order to do so
