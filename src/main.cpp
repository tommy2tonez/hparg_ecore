    //once we reach 1% lossless compression rate - we'll be rich fellas
    //we are planning f(x) -> y, x = 1GB, y = 10MB
    //gonna be epic - stay tuned

    //this probably will happen in 20-30 years - but we'll see what we could do
    //legend says that the one finds an operation superior to linear will rule the world
